## Relevant repositories

The following repositories are relevant for our REMLA group 18 project:

- [operation](https://github.com/remla25-team18/operation) - stores models and their versions, pointers to other repositories, general instructions how to run the app and a docker-compose file to run the whole project.
- [app](https://github.com/remla25-team18/app) - the main repository that contains the following sub-repositories:
    - [app-frontend](https://github.com/remla25-team18/app-frontend) - the frontend of the application, which is a web app that allows users to interact with the model and provide feedback.
    - [app-service](https://github.com/remla25-team18/model-service) - the backend of the application, which is a REST API that serves the model and handles user requests.
- [model-service](https://github.com/remla25-team18/model-service) - the model service, which is a REST API that serves the model and is responsible for sending generating predictions for requested comments.
- [model-training](https://github.com/remla25-team18/model-training) - the component that is responsible for training the model and generating a model version.

## Code base overview


## Progress log


# TODO:
– An explanation on how to start the application (e.g., parameters, variables, requirements).
– Pointers to relevant files that help outsiders understand the code base.
– Add a new paragraph for each assignment as a continuous progress log that (briefly) describes which assignment parts have been implemented to support the peer-review process.
